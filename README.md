## Integrating The Humanities into Data Science Education

A topic I am interested in is the integration of ethical and human-centered approaches into the technology field. Inspired by the article [Integrating The Humanities into Data Science Education: Reimagining the Introductory Data Science Course](https://iase-web.org/ojs/SERJ/article/view/42/455), the goal is to merge STEM and humanities to create an interdisciplinary course. This approach aims to provide a holistic education that emphasizes the ethical implications of technology, cultural representation in media, and computational social science.

Creating 3D data visualizations in Python is particularly exciting due to their dynamic and visually engaging nature. These visualizations can transform complex datasets into intuitive and interactive graphical representations, making data analysis more insightful and compelling.

## Datasets for Visualization Projects
Here are some datasets topics that interest me, with a corresponding description and link to dataset.

| Dataset       | Description   | Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Jail Deaths in America | The data represents jail mortality, which is not released publicly, but Reuters was able to obtain and release the data to the public. Coding it into a dataset might be interesting to visualize trends on how it occurs. | [Data](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/) |
| Marvel Comic Books and Characters | The data contains access to information about Marvel's vast library of comics. Visualizing this dataset is a fascinating way to understand common parts of different comic books. | [Data](https://developer.marvel.com/) |
| Women Elected Officials Database | This dataset provides the list of women candidates. Visualizing trends on how many women are representing society helps us realize what does or does not need to be changed. | [Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CFPBRI) |
